# Example

In this directory we have an example of using the `toperf` tool. This was a TCP benchmark running on the `maaxboard`, with two dummy programs 
running in the background. The samples are stored in `samples.json`, and the ELF files are in `/build/`.

## Converting to perf

Please run the following command to generate the `perf.data` file from the samples.json.
